Version 4.3 beta, release Notes

New way to install additional catalog using the menu Update / Install object catalog:
This replace the previous "Additional catalog" download.
The old GCVS and WDS catalog are now obsolete and must be reinstalled with the new tool.
There is choice for different version of variable and double star catalog depending on your needs.
More DSO catalog are included and the DSO pictures are updated for OpenNGC and Sh2.
New version for GCM, LBN, OCL need to be reinstalled.

Linux version is now build with Qt5. This imply some change in prerequisit packages and in the way to modify the program theme.

New calculation of the planetary satellites with CALCEPH library:
To have the best possible precision of the position it is now possible to calculate it using a SPICE kernel.
To do this, you have to install the corresponding data files from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/skychart/files/2-catalogs/SpiceKernel/
The skychart-spice-base file is required and you can add skychart-spice-ext for more satellites. The list of satellites in each file can be found on the download page.
On Linux you also need to install libcalceph before you can use this function: https://github.com/pchev/libcalceph/releases/tag/v3.4.7

New functions:
- use IERS data for UT1-UTC and pole motion, remove pole motion settings.
- Add 8 faint satellite of Jupiter, this require to install the updated Spice kernel as of November 2021.
- New program icon by Mattia Verga.
- Adjust magnitude and distance for the effect of proper motion.
- Update to latest version of solar and lunar eclipse catalog.
- For date before 1657 the Delta T computation is from Morrison, Stephenson, Hohenkerk, Zawilski 2021. 
- For date older than 1840-1950, depending on the country, when the LMT timezone is in use, the time offset is now for the longitude of the observatory.
- Can use SPICE kernel for NEO or other solar system objects. On Linux this require installation of libcalceph, see above.
- Use binary file instead of database for asteroid element, improve performance
- Show more asteroid information from the Asteroid lightcurve database
- Display object information directly from the Search window
- Add Alpaca telescope discovery
- Add civil twilight in the calendar
- Allow to import a mosaic in the observing list
- In Observer tool, stop the telescope motion when releasing the arrow button
- Use the nebula outlines from OpenNGC, add option to select line or surface
- Allow simulation for a single asteroid and comet
- Add menu "Window/Lock chart position" to not move the chart after a search
- Show hour angle and airmass under mouse cursor
- Add telescope handpad for ASCOM and INDI
- Add option to blure and set transparency of surface catalog
- Add pre-pointing feature for asteroid occultation
- Add button to lock the magnitude limit at the current value
- Add option to show the effect of atmospheric absorption on star magnitude
- Add drawing of pole movement due to precession
- Add a server command to lock on an object
- After a search for a constellation name only this constellation figure is plotted.
- Merge GAIA DR3 with XHIP for the default star catalog, when available all the bright stars astrometry is now from Gaia.
- New GAIA DR3 download are available, this is now in four part with limiting magnitude of 12,15,18,21. 
- Large performance improvement when using the new GAIA DR3 files for magnitude 18 and 21.

Bug fix:
- There was change in URL for TLE download, open Setup/Update/Artificial satellites, and click one of the two button to get the new URL
- Fix Bayer labels
- Update Quicksat to support the new magnitude file
- Fix PHD2 comet tracking interface
- Fix setting telescope time
- Planet in line mode must be really transparent 
- Fix "Show Mark" option for comet and asteroid simulation
- Fix the program startup with faulty printer driver

Removed:
- Move SAC to obsolete catalog, replaced by OpenNGC
- Remove Iridium flare computation

Take note you must not run this software with administrator right.
Since the version 4.2 a warning is show in the title bar if you do so.
Now this version refuse to start if launched as administrator.
If you are currently running your astronomy software in administrator mode it is time to change that because this is totally useless. The important point is you run all your software with the same user. But running all with the standard user is much better than running all in administrator!
