Shared library to use SPICE kernel from Pascal code.

CALCEPH is now the preferred library for Spice computation but if required 
you can still compile this one for Skychart.

The code in the cspice directory is from the SPICE Toolkit for C
available from:
https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html

Download the latest C toolkit for Linux, extract in a temporary directory.
Copy the content of src/cspice/ in the cspice directory here.
